-- Introduction

Robolympics is my pet project for experimenting with a Node.JS / Event Sourcing / CQRS based real-time web-application.

-- Getting started

git clone git@github.com:bforma/robolympics.git

Node packages are installed locally. Optionally you can `npm install supervisor -g` to speed up your development feedback cycle.
